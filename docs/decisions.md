## Settled

### 2026-08-25 — Dely is a lean automation-first plugin with an opt-in machine-local maintenance log

#### Context

The repository had 9,850 tracked lines after the automation-first release. The
runtime and installation surface accounted for 837 lines, while `docs/` accounted
for 6,918 and contract tests for 1,896. Claude Code, Codex CLI, and Grok Build each
copied the whole repository into an installed plugin, although their validators
reported only one skill directory and no commands or agents. Historical research,
completed migration material, a standalone push guard, and three prose-contract
test programs therefore shipped to ordinary users without contributing to plugin
installation or execution.

The delivery log had the same ownership problem. Every consuming project named and
tracked its own Markdown file even though the record exists to help a
later Dely maintenance session establish recurrence. That made plugin observations
part of project history and required every project to carry Dely-specific state.

#### Decision

Dely remains an automation-first thin control protocol. It owns the approved design
boundary, sequential implementation, independent review, bounded remediation, and
exact-HEAD release convergence. Orca owns dispatch, Git owns candidate state, and CI
plus the forge own release state. The shipped plugin surface is limited to the two
skills, their two Architectural templates, the harness manifests, concise installation
guidance, repository-maintainer instructions, this current decision, and one focused
structural contract test.

Completed research, superseded decisions, transient designs, the tracked project log,
and ancillary tooling outside the plugin component surface do not remain in the
current tree. Git history is their archive. The contract test checks only structural
public invariants; it does not attempt to parse or prove the semantics of the complete
English workflow contract.

The plugin version is `0.12.0` in both versioned manifests.

Maintenance logging is machine-local and opt-in at `~/.dely/log`:

- Dely never creates the directory or file. A missing path is skipped silently, and
  deleting the file opts out.
- Control appends exactly one physical line only after a delivery is accepted and all
  required checks are green. Aborted or incomplete deliveries are not recorded.
- The line contains an ISO-8601 UTC timestamp and labelled fields for the Git-root
  basename, plan, pull request or `none`, implementation-round count, ordered review
  dispositions, and one short drift-cause sentence. Tabs separate fields; embedded
  tabs and newlines become spaces. Acceptance is implicit because every record has
  already crossed that gate.
- Dely never reads this file for routing, recovery, or runtime decisions, and the text
  layout is not a public parsing schema.
- An append failure produces a visible warning but does not invalidate or block an
  otherwise accepted release.

#### Alternatives considered

- Keep a Git-ignored log inside each project. Rejected because it still creates plugin
  state in every checkout, splits observations across worktrees, requires ignore
  configuration, and can be committed accidentally.
- Keep the tracked project log. Rejected because plugin-maintenance observations do not
  belong in the consuming project's durable product history.
- Partition machine-local logs by repository or add a registry and stable hash.
  Rejected because one labelled line in one file is sufficient until basename
  collisions are observed to cost maintenance work.
- Retain all research and contract-test fixtures as maintainer-only material. Rejected
  because plugin managers copy them to every installation and Git already preserves
  them without keeping the current product surface ambiguous.
- Remove every test and durable decision. Rejected because one small structural check
  and one current rationale provide useful regression protection without restoring the
  previous documentation system.

#### Consequences

Ordinary installations become materially smaller and current documentation stops
presenting retired components as part of Dely. Projects no longer configure or commit a
delivery-log path. A maintainer who wants observations must create `~/.dely/log`
explicitly and is responsible for its permissions, retention, and deletion.

The machine-local log is not portable across machines. Two repositories with the same
root basename are not distinguished when no pull-request URL supplies context. Short
concurrent appends have no lock. Those limits are accepted because the log is optional
maintenance evidence and never a state owner.

Removing the standalone push guard is breaking for anyone who manually wired that file
as a Git hook. No compatibility stub remains. Dely's release contract still forbids
direct protected-branch release, force-push, and merge, but this decision does not claim
to replace repository branch protection.

Reducing the prose-contract suite also reduces the number of wording mutations rejected
mechanically. Independent review owns semantic verification; the remaining program
checks only shapes it can discriminate honestly.

#### Non-goals

No log reader, query command, rotation policy, lock manager, telemetry upload, automatic
instruction mutation, compatibility adapter, package builder, or second distribution
repository. No change to Orca, phase roles, review depth, remediation routing, setup's
two-row managed block, or the Architectural plan templates.

#### Deferred

Partition or strengthen project identity only after an observed basename collision makes
a record ambiguous. Add locking only after an observed concurrent append corrupts a
short record. Add rotation only after file growth causes a maintenance problem. A public
schema or reader requires a separate approved use case; ordinary maintenance reading by
a person or agent does not trigger one.
